# RETRO — SELF-CONTRAST Orchestrator

## Purpose

Run the full SELF-CONTRAST protocol in sequence: retrospective → gap analysis → friction detection → adversarial validation → prioritized actions. Produces a structured output with named score axes.

## When to Use

- End of session: "run /retro"
- After major implementation: "let's retrospective this"
- Before planning next phase: "what gaps do we have?"

## FLOW

```
1. /recap          → Session retrospective (what happened, problem vs optimal)
2. /gto            → Gap analysis (code/process gaps from session)
3. /friction       → Friction analysis (what blocked progress, what could be automated)
4. /pre-mortem     → Adversarial validation (what WILL fail)
5. /rns            → Action extraction (recover/prevent/realize)
```

### Red-Team Trigger

If any SCORES axis is below 8, invoke `/rns` with adversarial framing before finalizing actions:
- completeness_score < 8 → red-team gaps in coverage
- optimality_score < 8 → red-team approach quality
- satisfaction_score < 8 → red-team process/experience

## OUTPUT Format

```
RECAP: [2-paragraph session summary — problem vs optimal]

GAPS: [top 3 gaps identified]
  1. [gap description]
  2. [gap description]
  3. [gap description]

FRICTION: [top 3 friction points]
  1. [friction description — category: automation/manual/repeated]
  2. [friction description — category]
  3. [friction description — category]

SCORES:
  c:[0-10]  Completeness — were all gaps found?
  o:[0-10]  Optimality  — was the approach best possible?
  s:[0-10]  Satisfaction — smooth process?
```

### RNS Output (Final Section)

The retro ends with an RNS-formatted action list. Follow the `/rns` output format exactly — dynamic domain grouping, domain-numbered items, `@ file:line` references, gap coverage, and the `0 — Do ALL` footer.

```
1 🔧 QUALITY (2)
  1a [recover/high] Fix concurrent save registry integrity test @ test_critique_io_concurrent.py:89
  1b [prevent/med] Add Phase 2/3 filename round-trip tests @ test_critique_io.py

2 📄 DOCS (1)
  2a [realize/low] Update SKILL.md with Phase 1 completion gate @ SKILL.md

📋 GAP COVERAGE (7 items)
  5 MAPPED → see actions above
  1 REJECTED — "MECHANISM_LEAKAGE: hardcoded @gitready is low-risk branding, not a functional issue"
  1 DEFERRED — "ASSURANCE: AGENTS.template.md deferred to /skill-ship (owns skill wiring)"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

0 — Do ALL Recommended Next Actions (3 items)
```

**Format rules** (same as `/rns`):
- Domain sections use emoji headers (🔧 QUALITY, 📄 DOCS, etc.) — no markdown fences
- Items use domain-numbered format: `1a`, `1b`, `2a`
- Each item shows: `[action/priority] Description @ file:line`
- Within each domain sort: recover → prevent → realize, then CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW
- Gap coverage section accounts for ALL findings with explicit dispositions (MAPPED/REJECTED/DEFERRED)
- Ends with `0 — Do ALL Recommended Next Actions (N items)` — nothing follows after that line

### RNS Aggregation Rule (Critical)

**The RNS must include ALL findings from ALL chained skills, not just /pre-mortem.**

When building the action list, aggregate findings from:
- `/recap` — work already done, completed, or committed (do not include as actionable unless something was left incomplete)
- `/gto gap` — internal technical debt in the target itself (own by GTO if the target is GTO, otherwise own by the retro's target)
- `/friction` — workflow friction and automation opportunities (include all automation-potential items)
- `/pre-mortem` — adversarial findings by domain
- `/rns` — extracted actions from above
- **Prior retro carryover** — unresolved RNS actions from the previous session's retro. Check the session transcript for the last retro's RNS output and carry forward any items that were not executed. Each carryover item gets the same disposition as new findings (MAPPED/REJECTED/DEFERRED). Carryover items render with `(carryover)` tag in the action line.

**Every finding from every skill must appear in the RNS with an explicit disposition.** Each finding gets exactly one:
- **MAPPED**: Has a corresponding action item above
- **REJECTED**: Valid but intentionally not acted on — state why
- **DEFERRED**: Deferred to future session — name owner + trigger condition

**No finding is silently dropped.** If a finding is excluded, the GAP COVERAGE section states why.

**Failure mode this prevents:** RNS was previously built only from /pre-mortem findings, dropping GTO internal gaps (CAUSE-001/002/003, 7 TODOs in GTO test files) and workflow friction that no upstream skill flagged. The retro felt complete but was systematically incomplete.

## Step Execution

1. **Call `/recap`** — get session summary with problem/optimal contrast
2. **Call `/gto gap`** — extract top gaps from session evidence
3. **Call `/friction`** — identify workflow friction and automation opportunities
4. **Call `/pre-mortem`** — adversarial validation of approach
5. **Evaluate SCORES** — rate each axis 0-10:
   - If any axis < 8: re-run with adversarial framing before proceeding
6. **Aggregate** — merge ALL findings from all chained skills
7. **Render RNS output** — format the aggregated findings using the RNS output format (domain grouping, gap coverage, `0 — Do ALL` footer). Every finding must have a recommended next step or an explicit REJECTED/DEFERRED disposition.

## Red-Team Protocol

When SCORES reveals weakness:
1. Re-examine the weak axis with adversarial framing
2. Incorporate findings into GAPS or FRICTION as appropriate
3. Re-score with new data
4. Proceed to ACTIONS only after gaps are addressed or deferred

## Retrospective-Integrity Prompts

Before finalizing the retrospective, `/retro` should run a short internal retrospective-integrity check:

- What did we treat as a process win even though the outcome was suboptimal?
- What gap or friction point is duplicated across `/recap`, `/gto`, `/friction`, `/pre-mortem`, and `/rns` rather than being synthesized once?
- What score is being inflated or deflated without strong evidence from the chained skills?
- What action list would mis-sequence work by treating symptoms as the primary problem?
- What recommendation becomes misleading if the adversarial review surfaced a deeper failure mode?
- What positive takeaway is actually a workaround that should not be repeated?
- What workflow friction did we treat as normal even though it could be automated or eliminated?
- What would a weaker model smooth over instead of preserving as a real tradeoff or unresolved tension?
- What step in the chain returned weak or partial evidence, and did I compensate for that explicitly?
- What ownership boundary is still unclear between architecture, planning, verification, and implementation?
- What would make this retro feel complete while still teaching the wrong lesson?

These are internal self-check prompts. They are not default user-facing questions and should only surface to the user when `/retro` is genuinely blocked and cannot proceed safely without clarification.

## Trace, Emerge, Graduate, and Friction

`/retro` should use four internal helper passes:

- `trace`: reconstruct how the session or project path evolved, including the moments that most changed the outcome
- `emerge`: identify latent patterns across recap, gap analysis, friction, pre-mortem, and action extraction that no single sub-skill named explicitly
- `graduate`: promote repeated retrospective findings into durable process changes, validators, hooks, or workflow rules when warranted
- `friction`: actively scan chained results for repeated manual steps, missing automations, and workflow gaps that no upstream skill flagged

Use `trace` when the retrospective depends on a sequence of decisions or turning points.
Use `emerge` when multiple chained skills are pointing at the same hidden theme.
Use `graduate` when the same class of retro lesson keeps recurring and should become durable enforcement or policy.
Use `friction` when the session reveals manual patterns that could be automated or eliminated.

## Constraints

- Do NOT fabricate scores — derive from evidence in each step
- Do NOT skip steps — each feeds the next
- If a step returns no findings, note "none found" and proceed
- Red-team is advisory if scores are 6-7, mandatory if < 6
