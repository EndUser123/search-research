# /behave — LLM Behavioral Analysis

Structured hypothesis-testing analysis for LLM performance debugging in chat sessions.

## Purpose

Analyze session history to detect and diagnose behavioral patterns that indicate performance issues:
- **Loop detection**: Repeated failed approaches
- **Context degradation**: Lost context, forgotten details
- **Decision inefficiency**: Extended deliberation, reversed choices
- **Cognitive overload signals**: Confusion, excessive clarification requests
- **Attention drift**: Tangential responses, loss of focus

## When to Use

- After a session with unexpected behavior
- When pattern analysis is needed before diagnosis
- Debugging LLM performance issues systematically

## Output Format

**Required**: Bullet structure with explicit hypothesis labels (H₁, H₂, H₃), NOT tables or narrative conclusions.

---

## Step 1: Generate Candidate Hypotheses

For each observed symptom, generate 3-5 competing root cause hypotheses. **No filtering — list all candidates.**

Format:
```
H₁: [specific mechanism]
H₂: [alternative mechanism]
H₃: [third mechanism]
H₄: [fourth mechanism]
H₅: [fifth mechanism]
```

**Rule**: Do NOT suppress or pre-judge any hypothesis.

---

## Step 2: Cost-Order Tests

For each hypothesis, specify:

```
TEST METHOD: How to distinguish this from alternatives
DATA NEEDED: What evidence would falsify this
COST: Execution cost (log search, code trace, re-run, etc.)
```

**Order tests from cheapest to most expensive.**

| Cost Level | Examples |
|------------|----------|
| Cheap | Log search, grep, Read existing files |
| Medium | Add diagnostic print, verify data exists, swap tool |
| Expensive | Re-run in fresh context, cross-environment test |

---

## Step 3: Falsification

State which hypotheses remain **unfalsified** based on available evidence.

**Rule**: DO NOT converge to single hypothesis until alternatives are ruled out.

Format:
```
Unfalsified after available evidence: H₁, H₂, H₃ (H₄ ruled out by [evidence])
```

---

## Step 4: Confidence Calibration

| Remaining Candidates | Confidence Level |
|----------------------|------------------|
| 1 hypothesis | HIGH (H rejected) |
| 2-3 hypotheses | MODERATE (list candidates) |
| 4+ hypotheses | LOW (cannot converge without more data) |

**Only after Steps 1-4**: Produce structured output with confidence qualifier.

## Output Template

```markdown
Finding: [brief description of observed symptom]

Hypotheses:
  H₁: [specific mechanism]
  H₂: [alternative mechanism]
  H₃: [third mechanism]
  H₄: [fourth mechanism]

Test sequence:
  [Cheapest] [test description] → [expected distinguishing evidence]
  [Medium] [test description] → [expected distinguishing evidence]
  [Expensive] [test description] → [expected distinguishing evidence]

Unfalsified after available evidence: H₁, H₂, ...

Confidence: [HIGH/MODERATE/LOW] ([reason])

Finding: [restated with appropriate confidence qualifier]

## Analysis Categories

### 1. LOOP DETECTION

Symptoms:
- Repeated tool calls with same parameters
- Same error recurred multiple times
- Back-and-forth on same issue

Hypotheses for loops:
- H₁: Query succeeded but returned no useful data → retry with different params
- H₂: Code path not reached (wrong conditional) → verify condition evaluation
- H₃: Stdout capture failed (environment issue) → verify capture mechanism
- H₄: Silent failure in code execution → check exit codes, logs
- H₅: State not propagated between turns → verify state file updates

### 2. CONTEXT DEGRADATION

Symptoms:
- Forgetting earlier stated constraints
- Asking for information already provided
- Contradicting previous statements

Hypotheses for context degradation:
- H₁: Context window overflow → check token count vs limits
- H₂: Session compaction triggered → verify compaction events
- H₃: Handoff lost critical context → verify handoff completeness
- H₄: Implicit assumption not captured → check for unstated constraints
- H₅: Cross-session state stale → verify state file timestamps

### 3. DECISION INEFFICIENCY

Symptoms:
- Extended deliberation on simple choices
- Reversed decision after implementation
- Repeated refinement cycles

Hypotheses for decision inefficiency:
- H₁: Threshold too strict → analyze boundary conditions
- H₂: Missing decision criteria → trace criteria propagation
- H₃: Conflicting objectives → map objective hierarchy
- H₄: Information asymmetry → identify unknown unknowns
- H₅: Premature commitment → verify decision gate timing

### 4. COGNITIVE OVERLOAD SIGNALS

Symptoms:
- Excessive clarification requests
- Inconsistent reasoning between steps
- Missed obvious alternatives

Hypotheses for cognitive overload:
- H₁: Too many concurrent concerns → count active variables
- H₂: Analogous problems not recognized → check pattern matching
- H₃: Domain knowledge gap → identify unfamiliar constructs
- H₄: Output format too complex → measure output complexity
- H₅: Input noise overwhelming signal → check signal-to-noise ratio

### 5. ATTENTION DRIFT

Symptoms:
- Response addresses wrong aspect
- Tangential suggestions introduced
- Topic scope creep

Hypotheses for attention drift:
- H₁: Prompt intent unclear → analyze prompt structure
- H₂: Implicit scope not established → verify scope boundaries
- H₃: Distraction诱 introduced mid-response → check for injected context
- H₄: Topic boundaries fuzzy → identify boundary violations
- H₅: Response template mismatch → verify template fit

---

## Example

**Finding**: Lines 41-54 empty Python output

```
Hypotheses:
  H₁: Query succeeded but returned no matching data
  H₂: Code path not reached (wrong conditional)
  H₃: Stdout capture failed (environment issue)
  H₄: Silent failure in code execution

Test sequence:
  [Cheapest] Add print("REACHED") before query → check logs for execution confirmation
  [Medium] Verify target data exists before querying → ls/Read confirmation
  [Medium] Swap diagnostic tool → test with grep/glob alternative
  [Expensive] Re-run in fresh terminal context → cross-environment comparison

Unfalsified after available evidence: H₁, H₂, H₃ (H₄ ruled out by RC:0 exit)

Confidence: MODERATE (3 candidates remain; cannot converge without re-execution)

Finding: Model ran empty diagnostic without confirming prerequisites
```

---

## Prohibited Behaviors

DO NOT:
- Converge to single hypothesis before falsification
- Present LOW confidence as fact
- Skip hypothesis generation (need 3+ per symptom)
- Use tables or narrative for hypothesis output
- State findings without confidence qualifier
