## Artifacts Convention

All runtime artifacts write to:

```
P:/.claude/.artifacts/{terminal_id}/<skill-name>/
```

`terminal_id` from `CLAUDE_TERMINAL_ID` env var (falls back to `"default"`).

Skills MUST NOT write state to their own directory or to the package root. The `.gitignore` covers `.evidence/`, `.state/`, `.benchmarks/`, `__pycache__/`, `.claude/`.

## GTO Subagent Pattern

GTO dispatches parallel subagents (gap_finder, gto-logic, gto-quality, gto-code-critic) that write JSON to temp files, then merges results. Each subagent runs independently with its own output contract.

## Installation

Skills surfaced via junctions in `.claude/skills/`:

```powershell
New-Item -ItemType Junction -Path "P:/.claude/skills/<name>" -Target "P:/packages/cc-skills-meta/skills/<name>"
```

Command frontends live in `.claude/commands/<name>.md`.
