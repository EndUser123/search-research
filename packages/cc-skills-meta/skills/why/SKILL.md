# /why — Decision Archaeology

**Problem solved:** "I forgot why we're doing this. What caused it? What was the reasoning?"

This is NOT `/recap`. `/recap` tells you what happened chronologically. `/why` traces backward through decisions to reconstruct causal chains — who decided what, why, based on what assumptions.

## Workflow

### STEP 1: Parse the question

Extract the **topic** from the user's input. Strip the "/why" prefix and any question framing.

Classify the question type:

| Type | Pattern | Focus |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Decision chain** | `/why did we change X?`, `/why auth flow` | What decisions led to current state |
| **Existence rationale** | `/why do we have X?`, `/why does X exist?` | What pain point prompted X, what alternatives were considered, why this solution |
| **Self-referential** | `/why are we building a /why skill?` | Meta — trace the skill's own creation |
| **Open** | `/why` (no args) | Ask: "What topic do you want to trace?" |

| Input | Type | Topic |
|-------|------|-------|
| `/why auth flow` | Decision chain | auth flow decisions |
| `/why do we have nlm?` | Existence rationale | nlm |
| `/why are we building a /why skill?` | Self-referential | /why skill creation |
| `/why did we change the notebooklm skill?` | Decision chain | notebooklm skill changes |

### STEP 2: Gather evidence (search in parallel)

Run these data sources in parallel to find all mentions of the topic:

**Tier 1 — Primary (terminal-attributed, authoritative):**

1. **Session history** — `python "P:\.claude\skills\recap\scripts\recap_cli.py" recap`
   - Gets full session chain with problems/fixes/decisions per session
   - Terminal-attributed via `sessionId`/`session_chain_id`

2. **CKS knowledge** — `mcp__search-research__cks_search` with topic keywords
   - Prior decisions, feedback rules, lessons learned

3. **Memory files** — Search `C:\Users\brsth\.claude\projects\P--\memory\` for topic keywords
   - Project context, feedback rules, behavioral expectations

4. **CLAUDE.md + ADRs** — `Grep` for topic in `P:\.claude\CLAUDE.md` and `P:\__csf\arch_decisions\`
   - Architectural context and documented decisions

**Tier 2 — Supplementary (corroboration only, no terminal attribution):**

5. **Git log** — `git log --oneline --all --grep="{topic}" -20`
   - When changes were committed and what messages say
   - NOTE: Cannot attribute to specific terminal — use only to corroborate transcript evidence

6. **Git blame** — `git log -S "topic" --oneline` and `git log --follow -p -- {file}`
   - Who introduced changes and when (for file-level tracing)
   - NOTE: In multi-terminal environments, you cannot determine which terminal made which commit

### STEP 3: Extract causal markers

From gathered data, identify these signals:

**Decisions** (what was chosen):
- "decided to", "going with", "chose", "recommend", "use X instead of Y"
- User imperatives: "fix X", "add Y", "refactor Z"

**Triggers** (what caused the decision):
- Problem statements: "the issue is", "X doesn't work", "annoying pattern"
- External events: "nlm updated", "dependency changed", "security finding"

**Assumptions** (what the decision rests on):
- "assuming that", "if X then", "the expectation is"
- Implicit assumptions visible from context

**Corrections** (where reasoning changed):
- "actually", "wait", "hold on", "on second thought"
- User corrections: "no, not that", "that's not what I asked"

**Constraints** (what limited options):
- "can't do X because", "limited by", "must work with"
- Solo-dev constraints from CLAUDE.md

**For existence rationale questions, also extract:**

**Pain points** (what hurt before this existed):
- "annoying that", "wasting time on", "keep having to", "frustrating"
- Repeated manual actions that could be automated

**Solution selection** (why THIS solution vs alternatives):
- "considered X but went with Y because", "tried X, didn't work"
- Upstream tool features: "nlm skill install handles", "managed by external tool"

**Maintenance contract** (how it stays current):
- "run X to update", "managed upstream", "don't manually edit"
- Version pinning, update commands, freshness signals

### STEP 4: Reconstruct causal chain

Build backward from current state to origin:

```
Current State → Last Decision → What Triggered It → Earlier Decision → Original Need
```

For each link in the chain, identify:
- **Who**: User directive or AI recommendation?
- **What**: The specific decision made
- **Why**: The trigger/problem that motivated it
- **Based on**: What assumption or constraint
- **Changed by**: Any later corrections or overrides

### STEP 5: Surprise check (iterative drill-down)

After reconstructing the initial chain, examine each link for **surprise** — an answer that doesn't fully explain the link above it, or that raises a new question:

```
For each link in the chain:
  Ask: "Why was THIS specific answer true, and not something else?"
  If the answer is unexpected or unexplained → run a targeted search for that gap
  If the answer is obvious from context → move on
```

This recovers the iterative "ask why about each answer" quality of the five whys. One-shot evidence gathering is efficient but risks anchoring on the first narrative that fits. The surprise check forces a second pass where each layer gets challenged.

**Surprise signals to look for:**
- A decision was made but no one discussed alternatives → why was it the only option?
- A problem was stated but the fix seems disproportionate → was there a hidden constraint?
- The chain skips a step (Current State → Origin with nothing in between) → what happened in between?
- Two sessions contradict each other → what changed between them?
- A user correction appears mid-chain → what assumption was wrong?

**When surprise is found:** Do a targeted search (one of the 6 data sources) specifically for the gap. Don't re-run all searches — just the one most likely to fill the gap.

### STEP 6: Absent evidence check

Before presenting, identify what you **would expect to find but didn't**:

- If a decision was deliberate, you'd expect a user directive or discussion → absent?
- If a change was bug-driven, you'd expect error output or problem statement → absent?
- If an architecture choice was made, you'd expect ADR or CLAUDE.md entry → absent?

Missing expected evidence is itself a signal — it suggests the decision may have been:
- An accidental side effect (not deliberate)
- Made outside this project (imported pattern)
- Predates transcript history
- Made implicitly without conscious choice

Flag absent evidence as `[ABSENT EVIDENCE]` in the output.

### STEP 7: Present as narrative

**For decision chain questions:**

```markdown
## Why: {topic}

### Origin
{What first prompted this work — the original need/problem}

### Decision Chain
1. **{Decision}** — {when} — {rationale}
   - Triggered by: {what caused it}
   - Assumption: {what it rests on}
2. **{Decision}** — {when} — {rationale}
   - Course correction from #1: {what changed and why}

### Branching Analysis (if multiple causes)
If multiple valid causes exist at any decision point:
- **Path A**: {cause + evidence + where it leads}
- **Path B**: {cause + evidence + where it leads}
- **Selected**: {which path was taken and why}

### Current State
{Where things stand now and why}

### Key Assumptions
- {Assumption}: {still valid? yes/no/unknown}

### Verification
{How to confirm this causal chain is correct — what would disprove it?}

### Absent Evidence
{What you'd expect to find but didn't — what this absence suggests}
```

**For existence rationale questions** ("why do we have X?"):

```markdown
## Why: {topic}

### Pain Point (what hurt before this existed)
{The original problem that X was created to solve — what was annoying/broken/missing}

### Solution Selection (why THIS approach)
{What alternatives were considered and why this one was chosen}
- **Considered**: {alternatives found in evidence}
- **Chosen**: {what was selected and the rationale}
- **Rejected because**: {why alternatives didn't work}

### How it works now
{Current state — what it does, how it's maintained}

### Maintenance Contract
{How it stays current: upstream-managed? manually updated? version-locked?}

### Key Assumptions
- {Assumption}: {still valid? yes/no/unknown}

### Verification
{How to confirm this rationale is correct — what would disprove it?}

### Absent Evidence
{What you'd expect to find but didn't}
```

## Data Sources

### Tier 1 — Primary (terminal-attributed, authoritative)

| Source | Provides | How to access |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| `/recap` CLI | Session chain + semantic content | `python "P:\.claude\skills\recap\scripts\recap_cli.py" recap` |
| TranscriptParser | Decisions, patterns, corrections | Via recap output or direct grep of transcript |
| CKS | Prior decisions in knowledge base | `mcp__search-research__cks_search` |
| Memory | Feedback rules, project context | Search `C:\Users\brsth\.claude\projects\P--\memory\` |
| CLAUDE.md | Architectural constraints | `Grep` for topic keywords |
| ADRs | Documented architecture decisions | `Glob` in `P:\__csf\arch_decisions\` |

### Tier 2 — Supplementary (corroboration only, no terminal attribution)

| Source | Provides | How to access |
|--------|----------|---------------|
| Git log | Commit history and messages | `git log --oneline --all --grep="{topic}"` |
| Git blame | Who introduced changes | `git log -S "topic" --oneline`, `git log --follow -p -- {file}` |

**Why git is Tier 2**: In multi-terminal environments, git cannot attribute commits to specific terminals. Git shows author + timestamp but NOT which terminal session produced the change. Use git to corroborate transcript evidence, never as primary source for "which terminal/why."

## Fallback Strategy

If no evidence found for the topic:
1. Broaden the search — try related terms, abbreviations, parent concepts
2. Check git blame on relevant files — `git log --follow -p -- {file}`
3. Check CLAUDE.md for constraints that would explain it
4. If truly nothing found: "No decision trail found for '{topic}'. It may predate transcript history or was decided outside this project."

## Important Notes

- **Evidence-first**: Every claim in the output must trace to a specific data source. No speculation.
- **Causal, not chronological**: Order by causation, not by time. A decision from 3 sessions ago may be the root cause of today's work.
- **Include dead ends**: If a path was tried and abandoned, include it — that's valuable context for understanding why the current path was chosen.
- **Respect evidence tiers**: Tier 1 (transcript, CKS, memory) is authoritative. Tier 2 (git) is corroboration only. Tier 4 (unverified assumptions) must be marked `[UNVERIFIED]`.
- **Multi-terminal aware**: Git history cannot attribute commits to specific terminals. In multi-terminal environments, git evidence is supplementary — never use it as primary attribution for "which terminal decided X."
- **Compaction resilient**: If the current transcript is compacted, fall back to `history.jsonl` summaries via `walk_chain_simple()`. Compacted summaries retain decision markers even when full transcripts are garbage-collected.

### Relationship with `/recap`

`/why` traces causal chains. `/recap` provides the chronological overview that feeds into causal analysis:

- After `/why` surfaces a decision chain, use `/recap brief` to get the broader session context around those decisions
- If `/recap` surfaces something interesting (e.g., a recurring problem pattern), use `/why "why did we keep hitting X?"` to dig into the root cause
