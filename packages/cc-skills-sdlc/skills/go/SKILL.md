description: Execute a task from user input, plan file, or tasks.json queue and drive it to PR-ready completion. Handles intent parsing, task selection, worktree enforcement, verification, simplification, 7-pass review, and local artifact generation. Not for architecture, design, or refactoring — use /planning, /design_1.0, or /refactor instead.

# /go — Thin Orchestrator

**Role:** `/go` is a **thin orchestrator** that stay on `main`. It acquires a task (from user intent, a plan file, or a tasks.json queue), routes it to the correct SDLC skill, and records the outcome.

**Unified Schema:** All tasks and plans MUST adhere to the schemas defined in `__lib/sdlc_schemas.py`.

**MANDATORY SEQUENCE:** Worktree Check → Task Selection → Classify → Verify → Simplify → 7-Pass Review → QA Verification → PR Artifacts → Loop Check

**State root:** `.claude/.artifacts/{TERMINAL_ID}/go/`


---

## What /go Must Do

1. Enforce worktree + branch preconditions (auto-create if on main)
2. Acquire a task from one of three input sources
3. Classify task complexity → select model via Bifrost
4. Route to the correct SDLC skill based on task type and diff
5. Run verification commands from the task contract
6. Run `/simplify` if code changed
7. Run 7-pass review at the appropriate depth
8. Generate local PR artifacts
9. Emit the correct completion token

**What /go Must NOT Do:**
- Replace `/code` TDD workflow
- Replace `/refactor` cleanup logic
- Replace `/planning` task breakdown
- Use `plan.md` as a scheduler source
- Auto-push or create remote PRs

---

## Completion Tokens

- `<promise>PR_READY</promise>` — task done, all gates passed, artifacts written
- `<promise>BLOCKED</promise>` — task cannot proceed or max attempts reached
- `<promise>MORE_TASKS_IN_PLAN</promise>` — current task done, more remain
- `<promise>ALL_TASKS_COMPLETE</promise>` — no eligible tasks remain

---

## Required Environment

```bash
export TERMINAL_ID="${TERMINAL_ID:-$(uuidgen | cut -d'-' -f1 | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]')}"
export RUN_ID="${GO_RUN_ID:-$(uuidgen)}"
export MAX_ATTEMPTS="${MAX_ATTEMPTS:-3}"
export GO_STATE_DIR=".claude/.artifacts/${TERMINAL_ID}/go"
export GO_TASKS_FILE="${GO_TASKS_FILE:-.claude/tasks/tasks.json}"
export GO_PROMPT="${GO_PROMPT:-}"
export HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT="${HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT:-}"
export GO_PLAN_FILE="${GO_PLAN_FILE:-}"
mkdir -p "$GO_STATE_DIR"
```

---

## Task Input Sources

| Source | Env Var | Description |
|--------|---------|-------------|
| Direct prompt | `GO_PROMPT` | User's task description at invocation |
| Current session transcript | `identity.json` | Path to this session's transcript (read directly by the orchestrator) |
| Handoff transcript | `HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT` | Path to prior session transcript |
| Plan file | `GO_PLAN_FILE` | Path to `.md` plan file |
| Task queue | `GO_TASKS_FILE` | JSON file with queued tasks |

Priority: `GO_PROMPT` > **current session transcript** > `HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT` > `GO_PLAN_FILE` > `GO_TASKS_FILE`

When using prompt/transcript/plan, the task is synthesized into the contract below. When using the task queue, the first task with `status` in `{ready, queued, approved}` is selected.

---

## Task Contract

**Synthesized task** (from intent parsing):

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-04221-1430",
  "title": "Short title",
  "objective": "One-sentence objective",
  "status": "ready",
  "priority": "P1",
  "scope_in": [],
  "scope_out": [],
  "forbidden_files": [],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1"],
  "verification_commands": [],
  "task_type": "implementation",
  "routing": { "skill": "/code", "route": "code" }
}
```

**Queued task** (from `$GO_TASKS_FILE`):

```json
{
  "id": "TASK-001",
  "title": "Short title",
  "objective": "One-sentence objective",
  "status": "ready",
  "priority": "P1",
  "scope_in": ["fileA"],
  "scope_out": ["fileB"],
  "forbidden_files": ["secrets.env"],
  "acceptance_criteria": ["Criterion 1"],
  "verification_commands": ["pytest -q"],
  "task_type": "implementation",
  "requires_approval": false
}
```

**Allowed `task_type` values:** `implementation`, `refactor`, `design`, `planning`

---

## Routing Table

| Condition | Route |
|-----------|-------|
| Code behavior change needed | `/code` |
| Cleanup without behavior change | `/refactor` |
| Architecture or contract unclear | `/design_1.0` |
| Scope unclear or decomposition needed | `/planning` |
| Config/infra only | direct verify → reviews |

---

## STEP 0: Worktree Provisioning

`/go` stays on `main`. It creates a worktree for the worker, then dispatches the worker into it.

**Create a worktree for the task:**

```bash
TS=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
WORKTREE=".claude/worktrees/ai-task-$TS"
git worktree add -b "ai/ai-task-$TS" "$WORKTREE" HEAD
```

**Dispatch a worker into the worktree** using one of:

| Method | When to use |
|--------|-------------|
| `Agent` tool with `isolation: "worktree"` | Subagent does code changes |
| `Agent` tool with prompt instructing `EnterWorktree` | Worker needs to choose its own worktree |
| `claude -p` with `--cd "$WORKTREE"` | External CLI-based LLM |

`/go` remains on `main` throughout — it orchestrates, workers execute.

---

## STEP 0.5: Synthesize from Current Session Transcript

When `GO_PROMPT` is empty, read the current session transcript directly and synthesize the task from the last substantive user directive. This uses the orchestrator's native context-reading ability — no hook injection required.

**Transcript path:** `~/.claude/.artifacts/{TERMINAL_ID}/identity.json` → `session.transcript_path`

**Synthesize from transcript:**
1. Read the transcript JSONL file
2. Scan backwards from the end
3. Skip meta-instructions (`thanks`, `summarize`, `revert`, slash-command invocations) and correction messages (`No, the task is not about...`, `That's not what I asked`)
4. Stop at session boundary (different `session_chain_id`) or topic shift
5. Take the first substantive directive found — this is the task goal
6. Synthesize into `active-task_{RUN_ID}.json` and proceed to STEP 1

**Output:** `active-task_{RUN_ID}.json` with the same contract shape as a queued task, with `source: "transcript"` and `message_intent` observability fields.

If no transcript path is found or the transcript cannot be read, fall back to `HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT` → `GO_PLAN_FILE` → `GO_TASKS_FILE`.

---

## STEP 1: Task Acquisition

**From intent (GO_PROMPT / HANDOFF_TRANSCRIPT / GO_PLAN_FILE):** Parse intent and synthesize a task contract. Write `active-task_{RUN_ID}.json`.

**From queue (GO_TASKS_FILE):** Select the first task with `status` in `{ready, queued, approved}`.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/select-task.py"
STATUS=$?
[ "$STATUS" -ne 0 ] && exit 1
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.task-selected_$RUN_ID"
```

---

## STEP 1.5: Classify Complexity

Read `active-task_{RUN_ID}.json` and classify complexity. Select model for Bifrost routing.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/classify_complexity.py"
STATUS=$?
[ "$STATUS" -ne 0 ] && exit 1
```

Output: `model-selection_{RUN_ID}.json` with `{tier, model, confidence, signals}`.

| Tier | Model | Task types |
|------|-------|------------|
| T1-T3 | `M27` | implementation, refactor, config |
| T4 | `GLM-5.1` | design, planning |

Override: `GO_MODEL_OVERRIDE` env var bypasses classification.

---

## STEP 2: Route & Dispatch

Read `active-task_{RUN_ID}.json`. Route by `task_type`:

- `implementation` → `/code`
- `refactor` → `/refactor`
- `design` → `/design_1.0`
- `planning` → `/planning`

For `implementation`, check for existing code changes:
- `git diff --name-only HEAD` — if empty or docs only, skip TDD
- If code changes exist, invoke `/tdd` then `/code`

---

## STEP 3: Verification

Run every command in `task.verification_commands`. Record results.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/verify-task.py"
STATUS=$?
if [ "$STATUS" -ne 0 ]; then
  ATTEMPT_NEXT=$(find "$GO_STATE_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".attempt_*_$RUN_ID" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  [ "$ATTEMPT_NEXT" -ge "$MAX_ATTEMPTS" ] && touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.blocked_$RUN_ID" && echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>" && exit 1
  exit 1
fi
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.verified_$RUN_ID"
```

---

## STEP 4: Simplify

If docs-only diff, skip. Otherwise run `/simplify`.

```bash
DOCS_ONLY="$(python -c 'import json; d=json.load(open(".claude/.artifacts/'${TERMINAL_ID}'/go/diff-summary_'${RUN_ID}'.json")); print("true" if d.get("docs_only") else "false")' 2>/dev/null || echo false)"
if [ "$DOCS_ONLY" = "true" ]; then
  echo "Skipping simplify (docs-only)"
else
  /simplify > "$GO_STATE_DIR/simplify-status_$RUN_ID.md" 2>&1 || true
  grep -qiE 'CRITICAL|HIGH' "$GO_STATE_DIR/simplify-status_$RUN_ID.md" && {
    echo "ERROR: simplify HIGH/CRITICAL findings"
    touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.blocked_$RUN_ID"
    echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>"
    exit 1
  }
fi
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.simplified_$RUN_ID"
```

---

## STEP 5: 7-Pass Review

Run review passes at the depth determined by diff classification.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/review-passes.py"
STATUS=$?
[ "$STATUS" -ne 0 ] && exit 1
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.reviews-passed_$RUN_ID"
```

---

## STEP 6: QA Verification (GTO)

Run GTO quality verdict after 7-pass review, before PR artifacts. Routing-aware: design/planning tasks skip QA.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/run-qa-verification.py"
STATUS=$?
if [ "$STATUS" -ne 0 ]; then
  QA_VERDICT="$GO_STATE_DIR/qa-verdict-${RUN_ID}.json"
  if [ -f "$QA_VERDICT" ]; then
    QA_STATUS=$(python -c "import json; print(json.load(open('$QA_VERDICT'))['qa_status'])")
    echo "QA failed with status: $QA_STATUS"
  fi
  ATTEMPT_NEXT=$(find "$GO_STATE_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type f -name ".attempt_*_$RUN_ID" | wc -l | tr -d ' ')
  [ "$ATTEMPT_NEXT" -ge "$MAX_ATTEMPTS" ] && touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.blocked_$RUN_ID" && echo "<promise>BLOCKED</promise>" && exit 1
  exit 1
fi
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.qa-passed_$RUN_ID"
```

Output: `qa-verdict-{RUN_ID}.json` with `qa_status` in `{accept, accept-with-concerns, redo, error, skipped}`.

**qa_status mapping:**
- `accept` — all gates 0, GTO status accept
- `accept-with-concerns` — escape_hatches > 0 OR mixed_substance > 0 OR unverified_impl_claims > 0
- `redo` — GTO status revise/reject/blocked
- `error` — runner crashed or produced unparseable output
- `skipped` — task_type is design/planning (QA not applicable)

**go is NOT blocked globally.** This step's non-zero exit means QA found concerns — go's local policy decides whether to proceed. `accept-with-concerns` exits 0 and continues.

---

## STEP 7: Local PR Artifacts

Generate commit message, PR title, PR body, PR-ready report.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/pr-artifacts.py"
touch "$GO_STATE_DIR/.pr-ready_$RUN_ID"
echo "<promise>PR_READY</promise>"
```

---

## STEP 7: Loop Check

Check if more eligible tasks remain.

```bash
python ".claude/skills/go/scripts/loop-check.py"
```

---

## Prohibited Actions

- Workers making direct changes on `main` or `master`
- Using `plan.md` as scheduler source
- Proceeding without required prior flag
- Ignoring failed verification commands
- Ignoring HIGH/CRITICAL simplify findings
- Auto-pushing or creating remote PRs
- Modifying `forbidden_files` listed in task contract

## Evidence-First Principles

### E1 — Evidence before claims
Before claiming code is absent, unchanged, or non-existent — search the codebase and verify with tools first. Claims of absence are only valid after confirmed Read/Grep/git failures.

### E4 — Investigate before asking
Do NOT answer without reading relevant source files first. Do not ask the user for information you can obtain yourself via Read, Grep, Bash, git, or available MCP tools.

### E5 — Anti-lazy escape hatch
Prohibited:
- "I assume", "I think", "probably" without tool verification
- Claiming something doesn't exist without confirmed tool failure
- Skipping evidence gathering because the answer seems obvious
