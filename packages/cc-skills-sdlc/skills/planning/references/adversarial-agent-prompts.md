# Adversarial Agent Dispatch Prompts

Reference for Step 4b: Dispatch the 5 phase-1 agents in one parallel batch, then dispatch the critic in a second phase.

## Compaction Resilience -- Idempotent Agents

Each agent prompt prepends a pre-flight check: if its output file already exists and is non-empty, skip execution and return the path immediately. This means:
- Agents that completed before compaction return existing file path instantly (no re-run)
- Agents that didn't run execute normally
- After compaction, re-dispatch the same 6 agents with the same prompts; already-complete agents skip themselves
- The orchestrator only needs to check which output files exist to know what's done

## Agent Prompts

```python
# Phase 1: dispatch the 5 non-critic agents in one batch.
# Phase 2: dispatch the critic after the phase-1 findings exist.
# Each writes findings to file and returns ONLY the path.
# Each agent checks: if output file exists, skip and return path immediately.
#
# MANDATORY SUBSTITUTIONS BEFORE DISPATCH:
# - <plan_path>     = exact absolute plan path
# - <findings_dir>  = exact absolute per-plan/per-terminal adversarial directory
# - <findings_path> = exact absolute findings file path for the current agent
#
# Never dispatch a prompt containing the old sanitized-plan token. That means
# the orchestrator skipped path resolution and the agent may write to the wrong place.

## Rate Limit Retry Protocol (Step 4b-retry)

After agents return from Step 4b, Claude MUST check which agents produced valid findings files. Rate limits (429 errors) are temporary -- retry automatically.

```python
# Retry check: After the expected agents for the current phase return, verify findings files exist
# For each agent, check: does <findings_dir>/{agent}-findings.json exist and contain valid JSON with matching plan_path?

import json, os, time

ADVERSARIAL_DIR = r'<findings_dir>'
PLAN_PATH = r'<plan_path>'

expected_agents = [
    'compliance', 'logic', 'testing',
    'security', 'failure-modes', 'critic'
]

def check_findings():
    """Return list of agents that did NOT produce valid findings."""
    missing = []
    for agent in expected_agents:
        fpath = os.path.join(ADVERSARIAL_DIR, f'{agent}-findings.json')
        if not os.path.exists(fpath):
            missing.append(agent)
            continue
        try:
            data = json.loads(open(fpath, encoding='utf-8').read())
            if data.get('plan_path') != PLAN_PATH:
                missing.append(agent)  # Wrong plan — stale file
        except (json.JSONDecodeError, OSError):
            missing.append(agent)  # Corrupt file
    return missing

missing = check_findings()
if missing:
    print(f"RETRY_NEEDED: {len(missing)} agents need retry: {missing}")
    # Re-dispatch ONLY the missing agents (same prompts, same plan_path)
    # The idempotency check in each prompt ensures completed agents skip themselves
else:
    print("ALL_COMPLETE: All expected adversarial reviews produced findings")
```

### Retry Procedure

1. **Check**: After the current phase returns, run the check script above
2. **Retry 1**: Re-dispatch ONLY the failed agents (same prompts, same `plan_path`). The idempotency pre-flight check ensures completed agents skip instantly.
3. **Retry 2**: If agents still fail after Retry 1, wait briefly and re-dispatch failed agents one more time
4. **Give up gracefully**: After 3 total attempts (initial + 2 retries), proceed with whatever findings exist. Write the review summary noting which agents failed: "Rate-limited after 3 attempts: [agent list]"
5. **Never block indefinitely**: Maximum 3 total attempts per agent. Do NOT loop forever.

**Why this works**: The idempotency pre-flight check (already in every agent prompt) means re-dispatching the current phase is safe -- completed agents return their existing file path instantly. You can re-dispatch the whole phase for simplicity, or just the failed agents for efficiency.

**Retry dispatch pattern**: Use the exact same prompts from Step 4b. No modifications needed -- the idempotency check handles deduplication.

## Slot 5: External LLM Adversarial (DeepSeek via /ai-cli)

**Conditional**: This slot is ONLY dispatched when `SDLC_MULTI_LLM` env var is set to `"1"`.
If `SDLC_MULTI_LLM` is `"0"` or unset, skip this slot entirely and proceed with 4 Claude agents.

**Slot 5 dispatches via Bash (not Agent tool)** because it calls an external CLI.

### Pre-flight check

```bash
python -c "import os; print(os.environ.get('SDLC_MULTI_LLM', '0'))"
```

If output is not `"1"`, skip this entire section.

### Idempotency check

```bash
python -c "
import json, os, time
fpath = r'<findings_dir>/deepseek-adversarial-findings.json'
if not os.path.exists(fpath):
    exit(1)
try:
    data = json.loads(open(fpath, encoding='utf-8').read())
    age = time.time() - os.path.getmtime(fpath)
    if data.get('plan_path') == r'<plan_path>' and age < 86400:
        print(fpath)
        exit(0)
    os.remove(fpath)
except (json.JSONDecodeError, KeyError, OSError):
    if os.path.exists(fpath):
        os.remove(fpath)
exit(1)
"
```

If the above script prints a path, return ONLY that path.

### Dispatch via /ai-cli

```bash
python "P://packages/ai-cli/skills/ai-cli/ai_cli.py" "You are an adversarial plan reviewer. Review the plan at the provided context file for: 1) How would this plan fail under concurrent load or edge-case inputs? 2) What is the weakest assumption? 3) What contracts or schemas are implied but not defined? 4) What failure modes are most likely? Output findings as a JSON object with this exact schema: {\"plan_path\": \"<plan_path>\", \"agent\": \"deepseek-v3.2-adversarial\", \"model\": \"deepseek-v3.2\", \"findings\": [{\"severity\": \"HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW\", \"category\": \"string\", \"description\": \"string\", \"line_ref\": \"optional\"}], \"timestamp\": \"ISO8601\"}" --context "<plan_path>" --opencode-only --opencode-model chutes/deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3-0324-TEE --output-format json --no-critic --timeout 120
```

### Transform output to canonical findings path

After ai-cli returns, parse the JSON and write to:

```
<findings_dir>/deepseek-adversarial-findings.json
```

The ai-cli output has shape `{model, output, error, latency_ms}`. Extract `output` and attempt JSON parse. If `output` is not valid JSON, wrap the raw text as a single finding:

```python
import json, sys
from datetime import datetime, timezone
from pathlib import Path

ai_cli_output_path = sys.argv[1]  # path to ai-cli JSON output
canonical_path = r'<findings_dir>/deepseek-adversarial-findings.json'

raw = json.loads(Path(ai_cli_output_path).read_text(encoding='utf-8'))
output_text = raw.get('output', '')

try:
    findings_data = json.loads(output_text)
    if 'findings' not in findings_data:
        findings_data = {'findings': [{'severity': 'MEDIUM', 'category': 'general', 'description': output_text}]}
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    findings_data = {'findings': [{'severity': 'MEDIUM', 'category': 'general', 'description': output_text}]}

canonical = {
    'plan_path': r'<plan_path>',
    'agent': 'deepseek-v3.2-adversarial',
    'model': 'deepseek-v3.2',
    'findings': findings_data.get('findings', []),
    'timestamp': datetime.now(timezone.utc).isoformat(),
}
Path(canonical_path).write_text(json.dumps(canonical, indent=2), encoding='utf-8')
print(canonical_path)
```

### Fallback

If the ai-cli command fails (timeout, CLI unavailable, invalid JSON), log a warning:

```
[SDLC_MULTI_LLM] Slot 5 (DeepSeek) failed: <error>. Skipping external slot — 4 Claude agents still provide full coverage.
```

Do NOT dispatch a fallback Claude agent. The 4 existing Claude phase-1 agents provide full adversarial coverage. The external slot is additive only.

### Findings path

`<findings_dir>/deepseek-adversarial-findings.json`

The critic agent reads all `*-findings.json` from `<findings_dir>`, so this file is automatically ingested.
