# /friction — Interaction & Workflow Friction Detector

Detect two categories of friction: LLM interaction problems (errors, corrections, confusion) and workflow automation gaps (repeated manual steps, missing automations, commands that should be hooks).

Works standalone via `/friction` or embedded as a step within `/retro`.

## When to Use

- `/friction` — standalone analysis of recent friction
- Embedded in `/retro` between `/gto` and `/ideas`
- End of session: "what friction did we hit?"
- Investigating repeated manual steps or corrections

## Detection Modes

### Mode 1: Interaction Friction

Search chat history for correction patterns, errors, and LLM mistakes.

**Pattern markers**:
- "I disabled hooks" — Hook system friction
- "You are confused" — Context loss
- "enterprise bloat" — Solo-dev mismatch
- "wrong directory" — Path issues
- "errors in another terminal" — Cross-terminal contamination
- "you didn't call Skill" — Skill dispatch failures
- "old data", "cached data" — Stale data
- "same problem again" — Repeated problems without learning

**Categories**:

| Category | Root Cause |
|----------|-----------|
| Hook Contract Friction | Enforcement not distinguishing user-directed from autonomous work |
| Context Loss | Agents not reading conversation history before acting |
| Pattern Mismatch | Enterprise/team patterns in solo-dev environment |
| Path Issues | No path validation, inconsistent separators |
| Cross-Terminal | Shared state without terminal isolation |
| Skill Dispatch | Commands not triggering Skill() calls |
| Stale Data | Skills using caches instead of live reads |
| Repeated Problems | No learning loop from corrections |

### Mode 2: Workflow Friction

Scan session evidence and chat patterns for automation opportunities.

**Detection signals**:
- Same command run 3+ times in a session — candidate for a hook or skill
- Manual verification step repeated for each file — candidate for batch automation
- User explicitly approves the same category of action repeatedly — candidate for auto-allow
- Gaps between what skills produce and what user needs to do manually (copy results, reformat, re-run)
- Multi-step manual sequences that always appear in the same order — candidate for a workflow skill
- Manual cleanup after automated operations — missing post-processing in the automation

**Categories**:

| Category | Signal |
|----------|--------|
| Repeated Commands | Same bash/command invoked 3+ times |
| Manual Approval Loops | User approves same category repeatedly |
| Missing Automation | Deterministic steps done manually |
| Skill Output Gaps | User reformats or adapts skill output |
| Cleanup After Automation | Manual fixes after automated runs |
| Orphaned Work | Results produced but never consumed downstream |

## Analysis Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Evidence

Use `/search` for chat history, or analyze conversation context directly when embedded in `/retro`:

```
/search "recent errors"              # Interaction friction
/search "repeated commands"           # Workflow friction
```

When embedded in `/retro`, use the already-gathered recap and gap context — do not re-run `/search`.

### Phase 2: Detect Patterns

For **interaction friction**, search for correction markers (errors, wrong approaches, user redirects).

For **workflow friction**, scan for:
- Repeated tool calls with same patterns
- Manual steps between automated ones
- User doing work that a hook or skill could handle

### Phase 3: Categorize and Score

For each finding, assign:
- **Category**: Which friction type (from tables above)
- **Frequency**: How many times it occurred in the analysis window
- **Automation potential**: HIGH (clear deterministic fix), MED (needs judgment), LOW (needs human input)
- **Effort to fix**: Estimated complexity of eliminating the friction

### Phase 4: Output Findings

## Output Format

### Standalone Mode

```
FRICTION FINDINGS:

Interaction Friction:
  1. [category] "[quote]" (N occurrences, effort: HIGH)
  2. [category] "[quote]" (N occurrences, effort: MED)

Workflow Friction:
  1. [category] [description] (N occurrences, automation: HIGH)
  2. [category] [description] (N occurrences, automation: MED)

Top 3 Recommendations:
  1. [specific fix] — eliminates [N] manual steps per session
  2. [specific fix] — prevents [category] friction
  3. [specific fix] — automates [description]
```

### Embedded Mode (within /retro)

Produce compact output for the FRICTION section:

```
FRICTION: [top 3 friction points]
  1. [description] — [category: automation/manual/repeated]
  2. [description] — [category]
  3. [description] — [category]
```

## Tips

1. Count occurrences — frequency determines priority
2. Quote directly from chat when available — evidence over inference
3. Distinguish interaction friction (LLM mistakes) from workflow friction (process gaps)
4. Every workflow friction finding should suggest a concrete automation (hook, skill, or config change)
5. When embedded in `/retro`, skip re-gathering evidence — use what upstream skills already collected
