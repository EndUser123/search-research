"""
/refactor - Multi-File Refactoring Orchestrator

Implements 8 priority improvements:
1. Rollback Automation (git-based)
2. Test Generation Integration (TDD phases)
3. Synergy Detection (cross-file patterns)
4. Complexity Triage (risk-based prioritization)
5. Incremental Refactoring Mode (state persistence)
6. Configuration-Based Thresholds (CLI + config file)
7. Progress Persistence (tracking completed findings)
8. Integration with /synergy skill
