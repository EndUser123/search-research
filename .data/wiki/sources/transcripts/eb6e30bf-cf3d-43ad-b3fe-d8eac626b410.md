Claude Code Hooks Complete Guide - Deterministic Enforcement Across the Tool Lifecycle

First Published: 2026-06-07

Last Updated: 2026-06-07

This article is the deep-dive companion to my 

Claude Code Harness and Environment Engineering Guide

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_code_harness_and_environment_engineering_guide.html

, which introduces hooks as one layer of the overall control stack. Here I take that one layer all the way down: every hook event and where it fires, the two channels a hook uses to talk back to Claude Code, how to scope a hook to specific tools, and a set of copy-ready examples you can drop into 

settings.json

 today.

Source-of-truth note: the hook event names, input JSON fields, exit-code semantics, and JSON output fields below were verified against the official Claude Code hooks reference and hooks guide at the time of writing. The set of hook events grows over time; the official reference remains authoritative.

1. Introduction — Why Hooks Exist

A system prompt is a request. A hook is a guarantee.

When you tell Claude Code "always run the formatter after editing a file," or "never touch the production credentials file," you are asking a language model to comply. Most of the time it will. But "most of the time" is not a security posture, and it is not a CI gate. A model can be steered by an unusual prompt, distracted by a long task, or simply make a mistake. If the only thing standing between an agent and an irreversible action is a politely worded instruction, you do not have a control — you have a hope.

Hooks move that control out of the model and into the harness. A hook is a user-defined command (or HTTP endpoint, or MCP tool, or sub-model evaluation) that Claude Code executes deterministically at a fixed point in the tool-and-conversation lifecycle. The model does not decide whether the hook runs. The harness does. When a 

PreToolUse

 hook exits with a blocking status, the tool call is blocked — regardless of what the model intended, what the user prompt said, or how the conversation was steered to that point. That is the entire value proposition: 

hooks make the enforcement deterministic where the prompt makes it probabilistic.

This guide is the reference for that enforcement layer. It covers the full set of hook events and where each one fires in the lifecycle, the two ways a hook communicates back to Claude Code (exit codes and structured JSON), how matchers scope a hook to specific tools, where hook definitions live across the settings hierarchy, and a set of worked examples you can adapt directly: auto-formatting on write, blocking secrets and dangerous commands, audit logging, guarding the end of a turn, and injecting context at session start. It closes with how hooks relate to the two other control surfaces — the permission system and 

CLAUDE.md

 — and with the security model and anti-patterns that matter once hooks are running with your full shell privileges.

This article is a companion to the broader 

Claude Code Harness and Environment Engineering Guide

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_code_harness_and_environment_engineering_guide.html

, which introduces hooks as one layer of the overall control stack. Here we go deep on that one layer. For the surrounding settings model and the permission rules hooks interact with, see the 

Claude Code Features and Settings Reference

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_code_features_settings_reference_2026.html

. Audience: platform and security engineers, and developers who want Claude Code to run autonomously without giving up deterministic guardrails.

A note on scope. This guide covers hooks as configured for the Claude Code CLI through 

settings.json

 and component frontmatter. The Claude Agent SDK exposes a programmatic hook interface in code rather than JSON; that surface is covered in the 

Claude Agent SDK Complete Guide

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_agent_sdk_complete_guide.html

. We also do not restate the full permission model or the complete 

settings.json

 schema — those live in the references linked above. Prices, quotas, and model-specific billing are out of scope by site policy; where a feature interacts with model effort or cost, we describe the mechanism and link to the official documentation.

2. The Hook Lifecycle

To use hooks well you have to see the timeline they hang off. A single Claude Code turn is not one event — it is a sequence: the session starts, the user submits a prompt, the model thinks and emits tool calls, each tool call is checked and executed and observed, and eventually the model stops and the turn ends. Hooks fire at the boundaries between these phases. Picking the right event is mostly a matter of knowing which boundary you care about.

The figure below maps the major events onto that timeline. Read it top to bottom as the flow of a turn, with the inner tool loop (the part that repeats for every tool the model calls) drawn as a cycle — the dashed arrow back to 

PreToolUse

 is the per-tool-call repetition.

 

Claude Code Hook Lifecycle: Where Each Event Fires Across a Turn

The phases, in order:

Session boundary.

 When a session starts or resumes, 

SessionStart

 fires once. Around it sit 

Setup

 (one-time project initialization in headless mode), 

InstructionsLoaded

 (each time a 

CLAUDE.md

 or rules file is read into context), and the configuration watchers 

ConfigChange

 and 

CwdChanged

 . When the session ends, 

SessionEnd

 fires.

Prompt boundary.

 Each time the user submits a message, 

UserPromptSubmit

 fires before the model sees it — the single most useful place to inject just-in-time context or to reject a prompt outright. If the prompt expands a slash command, 

UserPromptExpansion

 fires as that expansion happens.

The tool loop (repeats per tool call).

 This is the heart of the model. For each tool the model wants to use, 

PreToolUse

 fires 

before

 execution and can block it. The permission flow may fire 

PermissionRequest

 (a dialog is about to be shown) and 

PermissionDenied

 (auto-mode rejected the call). After the tool runs, exactly one of 

PostToolUse

 (success) or 

PostToolUseFailure

 (failure) fires. When the model issues several tools in parallel, 

PostToolBatch

 fires once after the whole batch resolves and before the next model call.

Subagents and tasks.

 If the model spawns a subagent, 

SubagentStart

 and 

SubagentStop

 bracket its run; a 

Stop

 hook registered inside a subagent is automatically treated as 

SubagentStop

 . Task tracking emits 

TaskCreated

 and 

TaskCompleted

 , and agent-team coordination emits 

TeammateIdle

 .

Context management.

 When the conversation approaches the context limit and Claude Code compacts the transcript, 

PreCompact

 fires before and 

PostCompact

 after.

Turn boundary.

 When the model finishes responding, 

Stop

 fires — and, crucially, can refuse to let the turn end (sending control back to the model with a reason). If the turn ends because of an API error instead, 

StopFailure

 fires.

Display, files, and MCP.

 

Notification

 fires when Claude Code surfaces a notification; 

MessageDisplay

 fires as assistant text is shown and can even rewrite what the user sees. 

FileChanged

 watches files on disk; 

WorktreeCreate

 and 

WorktreeRemove

 bracket git worktree lifecycle; 

Elicitation

 and 

ElicitationResult

 bracket an MCP server asking the user for structured input.

You will spend most of your time with a handful of these — 

PreToolUse

 , 

PostToolUse

 , 

UserPromptSubmit

 , 

Stop

 , 

SessionStart

 , 

SubagentStop

 , and 

PreCompact

 . The rest are there when you need them. Section 3 walks the full set; the deep dives concentrate on the events that carry the most weight in practice.

3. The Hook Events

Claude Code defines on the order of thirty hook events as of this writing. Because the set is actively expanding, treat the 

official hooks reference

https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks

 as the canonical list — do not assume an event exists (or does not) based on memory. The tables below group the current events by the lifecycle phase from Section 2, with the firing condition and whether the event accepts a matcher (Section 5).

3.2 Common Input

Every hook receives a single JSON object on standard input. A common set of fields is present on all events:

{
  "session_id": "abc123",
  "transcript_path": "/Users/you/.claude/projects/.../transcript.jsonl",
  "cwd": "/Users/you/my-project",
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "permission_mode": "default"
}


permission_mode

 reflects the current mode ( 

default

 , 

plan

 , 

acceptEdits

 , 

auto

 , 

dontAsk

 , or 

bypassPermissions

 ). When a hook runs inside a subagent, the input additionally carries 

agent_id

 and 

agent_type

 , which is how you tell a subagent's tool call apart from the main agent's. An 

effort

 object ( 

{"level": "low" | "medium" | "high" | "xhigh" | "max"}

 ) is present where applicable. Individual events add their own fields on top of this base, described below.

3.3 The High-Value Events in Depth

PreToolUse — the gate.

 This is the event you reach for when you want to 

prevent

 something. It fires after the model has decided to use a tool but before the tool runs, and it can block. The input adds 

tool_name

 (e.g. 

Bash

 , 

Edit

 , 

Write

 , or an MCP tool like 

mcp__github__create_issue

 ) and 

tool_input

 — the structured arguments the model produced. For a 

Bash

 call, 

tool_input.command

 is the shell string; for an 

Edit

 , 

tool_input.file_path

 and the edit payload. A 

PreToolUse

 hook can do three useful things: block the call (deny), force the user to confirm (ask), or silently allow and even rewrite the arguments ( 

updatedInput

 ). This is where command allow/deny-listing, secret-file protection, and "never run destructive commands unattended" rules live. Two properties make it the strongest control surface in Claude Code. A 

PreToolUse

 

deny

 is evaluated 

before

 any permission-mode check, so it blocks the tool even under 

bypassPermissions

 or 

--dangerously-skip-permissions

 — a user cannot escape it by switching their permission mode. And a hook can only tighten, never loosen: returning 

allow

 skips the interactive prompt but does 

not

 override a matching 

deny

 or 

ask

 rule in settings, so a hook can never grant more access than the permission system already would.

PostToolUse — the reaction.

 Fires after a tool call succeeds. The input carries 

tool_name

 , 

tool_input

 , and 

tool_response

 (the result the tool produced). It cannot un-run the tool — the side effect already happened — but it can react: run a formatter on the file that was just written, lint it, append an audit record, or feed information back to the model as 

additionalContext

 . The companion 

PostToolUseFailure

 fires when the tool failed and additionally carries 

tool_error

 . 

PostToolBatch

 fires once after a parallel batch and receives 

batch_results

 , an array of the resolved tool outcomes — useful when you want to react to a whole fan-out rather than each call.

UserPromptSubmit — the context injector and prompt gate.

 Fires the moment the user submits, before the model processes the prompt. The input adds 

prompt

 (the raw text). Two things make this event special. First, its standard output is fed directly into the model's context — so printing text from this hook is a clean way to inject just-in-time context (the current git branch, an on-call notice, today's deployment freeze) into every turn. Second, it can block: a blocking result rejects the prompt and erases it from context, which lets you stop a prompt that violates policy before the model ever reads it. The two powers compose: a single 

UserPromptSubmit

 hook can inject the current freeze status as context 

and

 reject any prompt that asks to deploy while a freeze is on — so the model stays aware of policy on every turn and never even sees a request that violates it.

Stop / SubagentStop — the turn guard.

 

Stop

 fires when the model is about to finish its response. Blocking it does not end the turn — it sends control back to the model with your 

reason

 , telling it to keep working. This is the mechanism behind "don't stop until the tests pass" or "warn me if there are uncommitted changes before ending." 

SubagentStop

 is the same idea for a subagent; note that a 

Stop

 hook registered inside a subagent is automatically converted to 

SubagentStop

 . Use the turn guard sparingly — a 

Stop

 hook that always blocks will loop forever (Section 10).

SessionStart — the bootstrap.

 Fires once when a session starts or resumes. The input carries 

source

 ( 

startup

 , 

resume

 , 

clear

 , or 

compact

 ), the 

model

 , and an optional 

session_title

 . Its stdout, like 

UserPromptSubmit

 , is injected as context — so this is where you seed the agent with the state it needs before the first prompt: recent commits, open issues, the contents of a scratchpad. Its JSON output can also set 

watchPaths

 , reload skills, or even supply an 

initialUserMessage

 to kick off the session automatically. 

SessionStart

 , 

Setup

 , 

CwdChanged

 , and 

FileChanged

 hooks can additionally write 

export VAR=value

 lines to the file named by 

CLAUDE_ENV_FILE

 to persist environment variables into every subsequent 

Bash

 command in the session.

PreCompact — the memory checkpoint.

 Fires before Claude Code compacts the transcript to stay under the context limit, with 

trigger

 set to 

manual

 or 

auto

 . Use it to snapshot important state to disk before earlier turns are summarized away, or to block an automatic compaction you would rather defer. 

PostCompact

 fires after the summary is in place.

PermissionRequest and PermissionDenied — the permission-flow hooks.

 These sit inside the tool loop alongside 

PreToolUse

 , but they hook the permission machinery rather than the call itself. 

PermissionRequest

 fires when Claude Code is about to show a permission dialog; a hook can pre-empt the dialog by returning a nested 

decision

 of 

allow

 or 

deny

 , optionally rewriting the input and even adding a standing permission rule on allow ( 

addPermissionRuleOnAllow

 ). 

PermissionDenied

 fires when auto-mode's classifier has rejected a call; a hook can return 

retry: true

 to tell the model it may try again. Together with 

PreToolUse

 they give you three distinct points to shape one tool call: gate it ( 

PreToolUse

 ), resolve its permission dialog ( 

PermissionRequest

 ), or recover from an auto-denial ( 

PermissionDenied

 ).

Notification and the rest.

 

Notification

 (carrying 

message

 and 

notification_type

 ) is handy for routing Claude Code's notifications to Slack or a desktop notifier. 

MessageDisplay

 can rewrite assistant text before the user sees it (redaction, for instance). 

FileChanged

 , 

WorktreeCreate

 / 

WorktreeRemove

 , and the MCP 

Elicitation

 pair round out the set for more specialized automation. Reach for them when the lifecycle phase they cover is exactly what you need to observe.

4. The Communication Protocol

A hook talks back to Claude Code in two ways: a coarse channel (the process exit code) and a fine channel (a JSON object on standard output). Most simple hooks use exit codes alone. Anything that needs to make a decision, inject context, or rewrite an argument uses JSON. You can think of exit codes as the fast path and JSON as the expressive path.

 

Hook Communication Protocol: Exit Codes and JSON Decisions

4.1 The Exit-Code Channel

Claude Code interprets a hook's exit code as follows:

Exit code

Meaning

Effect

0

Success

Standard output is parsed as JSON (Section 4.2). For a few events, non-JSON stdout is treated as plain-text context.

2

Blocking error

Standard error is fed back as the reason; the action is blocked for events that support blocking.

other ( 

1

 , 

3

 , …)

Non-blocking error

Standard error is shown in the transcript (first line) and the debug log; execution continues.

The key distinction is exit 

2

 . For a 

PreToolUse

 hook, exiting 

2

 blocks the tool call and the contents of 

stderr

 are surfaced to the model as the reason it was blocked. The simplest possible deny hook is therefore a one-liner: inspect the input, print a reason to 

stderr

 , and 

exit 2

 .

Which events actually 

block

 on exit 

2

 matters, because it is not all of them. Blocking events include 

PreToolUse

 (blocks the tool), 

PermissionRequest

 (denies), 

UserPromptSubmit

 and 

UserPromptExpansion

 (block the prompt/expansion), 

Stop

 and 

SubagentStop

 (prevent stopping), 

TaskCreated

 / 

TaskCompleted

 (roll back / prevent), 

ConfigChange

 (block the change), 

PreCompact

 (block compaction), 

PostToolBatch

 (halts the agentic loop before the next model call), 

Elicitation

 / 

ElicitationResult

 , and 

TeammateIdle

 . For the observe-only events — 

PostToolUse

 and 

PostToolUseFailure

 — exit 

2

 does not undo anything; it simply surfaces 

stderr

 to the model. For purely informational events such as 

SessionStart

 , 

Notification

 , 

SubagentStart

 , 

CwdChanged

 , 

FileChanged

 , 

PostCompact

 , and 

SessionEnd

 , exit 

2

 is shown to the user (or ignored) and blocks nothing. 

WorktreeCreate

 is the special case: 

any

 non-zero exit fails the worktree creation.

4.2 The JSON Channel

For anything beyond block/allow, exit 

0

 and print a single JSON object to stdout. A set of universal fields applies to every event:

{
  "continue": true,
  "stopReason": "Message shown to the user when continue is false",
  "suppressOutput": false,
  "systemMessage": "Warning surfaced to the user"
}


continue: false

 stops Claude Code entirely, regardless of event, with 

stopReason

 shown to the user (not the model). 

suppressOutput: true

 hides the hook's stdout from the transcript (it still goes to the debug log). 

systemMessage

 surfaces a warning in the interface. A 

terminalSequence

 field (restricted OSC/BEL escape sequences) can trigger desktop notifications or window-title changes.

On top of the universal fields, events carry decision controls. There are two shapes, and getting them right is the most common source of hook bugs.

Most decision-capable events use a top-level decision :

{
  "decision": "block",
  "reason": "Explanation shown to the user / fed back to the model",
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PostToolUse",
    "additionalContext": "Extra text added to the model's context"
  }
}


This shape applies to 

UserPromptSubmit

 , 

UserPromptExpansion

 , 

PostToolUse

 , 

PostToolUseFailure

 , 

PostToolBatch

 , 

Stop

 , 

SubagentStop

 , 

ConfigChange

 , and 

PreCompact

 . Setting 

decision: "block"

 blocks (or, for 

Stop

 , refuses to stop) with 

reason

 as the explanation.

PreToolUse is different — it uses hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision :

{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
    "permissionDecision": "deny",
    "permissionDecisionReason": "Editing the production credentials file is not allowed.",
    "additionalContext": "Optional context for the model",
    "updatedInput": { "command": "rewritten command" }
  }
}


The 

permissionDecision

 field takes one of four values:

allow

 — auto-approve the call with no permission dialog.

deny

 — block the call; 

permissionDecisionReason

 is sent to the model.

ask

 — escalate to the interactive user permission dialog.

defer

 — defer to the normal permission flow (equivalent to exiting 

0

 with no JSON).

When you return 

updatedInput

 to rewrite the tool's arguments, you must also return 

permissionDecision: "allow"

 or 

"ask"

 — the rewrite and the decision travel together. The related 

PermissionRequest

 event uses a nested 

hookSpecificOutput.decision

 object ( 

{"behavior": "allow" | "deny", "updatedInput": …, "addPermissionRuleOnAllow": "Bash(npm *)"}

 ), and 

PermissionDenied

 uses 

hookSpecificOutput.retry: true

 to let the model retry a denied call.

4.3 stdout, stderr, and Context Injection

Where a hook's stdout goes depends on the event. For most events, exit- 

0

 stdout is parsed as JSON and otherwise sent only to the debug log. But for a specific set — 

UserPromptSubmit

 , 

UserPromptExpansion

 , and 

SessionStart

 — plain-text stdout is injected into the model's context. This is the clean way to add context without JSON: a 

SessionStart

 hook that prints 

git log --oneline -10

 puts the last ten commits in front of the model on every session. ( 

MessageDisplay

 is the related but distinct case: it rewrites what the 

user

 sees, through its 

displayContent

 JSON field rather than raw stdout.) Tool-loop events ( 

PreToolUse

 , 

PostToolUse

 , and friends) carry their context through 

additionalContext

 rather than raw stdout. 

stderr

 is the reason channel for blocking; on a non-blocking exit it lands in the transcript and debug log.

5. Matchers and Scoping

A hook event without a matcher fires on every occurrence. A matcher narrows it — most often to specific tools, but for several events to other discriminators like the session source or the compaction trigger.

5.1 Matcher Syntax

Claude Code evaluates a matcher string with three rules:

Matcher

Interpreted as

Example

"*"

 , 

""

 , or omitted

Match everything

fires on all

Only letters, digits, 

_

 , and 

|

Exact string, or 

|

 -separated list of exact strings

Bash

 , 

Edit|Write

Anything else

JavaScript regular expression

^Notebook

 , 

mcp__memory__.*

The third rule is a frequent trap with MCP tools. MCP tool names follow the pattern 

mcp__<server>__<tool>

 — and because 

mcp__memory

 contains only letters and underscores, it is treated as an 

exact

 match and will never match 

mcp__memory__create_entities

 . To match all tools from a server you must force regex evaluation, e.g. 

mcp__memory__.*

 . Likewise 

mcp__.*__write.*

 matches write-style operations across every MCP server.

5.2 Which Events Scope on What

Matchers do not always filter on tool name. The discriminator depends on the event:

Tool name

 — 

PreToolUse

 , 

PostToolUse

 , 

PostToolUseFailure

 , 

PermissionRequest

 , 

PermissionDenied

 (e.g. 

Bash

 , 

Edit|Write

 , 

mcp__.*

 ).

Session source

 — 

SessionStart

 ( 

startup

 , 

resume

 , 

clear

 , 

compact

 ).

Termination reason

 — 

SessionEnd

 ( 

clear

 , 

resume

 , 

logout

 , …).

Trigger

 — 

PreCompact

 , 

PostCompact

 ( 

manual

 , 

auto

 ); 

Setup

 ( 

init

 , 

maintenance

 ).

Agent type

 — 

SubagentStart

 , 

SubagentStop

 ( 

Explore

 , 

Plan

 , custom names).

Notification / config source / error type / load reason

 — 

Notification

 , 

ConfigChange

 , 

StopFailure

 , 

InstructionsLoaded

 .

MCP server name

 — 

Elicitation

 , 

ElicitationResult

 .

Literal filenames

 — 

FileChanged

 (a watch list, not a regex).

Several events take no matcher and always fire: 

UserPromptSubmit

 , 

PostToolBatch

 , 

Stop

 , 

TeammateIdle

 , 

TaskCreated

 , 

TaskCompleted

 , 

WorktreeCreate

 , 

WorktreeRemove

 , 

CwdChanged

 , 

MessageDisplay

 .

5.3 The Settings Hierarchy

Hooks are defined in the same layered settings files as the rest of Claude Code's configuration, and the layer a hook lives in determines who it applies to and who can override it:

Location

Scope

Shared?

~/.claude/settings.json

All your projects (user)

No

.claude/settings.json

One project

Yes — commit to the repo

.claude/settings.local.json

One project

No — git-ignored

Managed policy settings

Organization-wide

Yes — admin-controlled

Plugin 

hooks/hooks.json

When a plugin is enabled

Yes — with the plugin

Skill / agent frontmatter

While the component is active

Yes — in the component

Hooks from all applicable layers are merged, and the resolution order is 

Managed > Local > Project > Plugin > User

 — a higher-priority layer wins, so a hook in managed settings overrides one in local, project, plugin, or user settings. The practical consequence for platform teams: a hook defined in managed policy settings cannot be overridden or disabled by a user's personal config, which is exactly what you want for a non-negotiable guardrail. We return to this in Section 9.

6. Configuration in settings.json

6.1 The hooks Block

A hook configuration is a tree: the top-level 

hooks

 key maps each event name to an array of matcher entries; each matcher entry pairs a 

matcher

 string with an array of hook handlers to run when it matches. Here is the canonical shape for a 

PreToolUse

 hook scoped to 

Bash

 :

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/guard-bash.sh",
            "timeout": 30,
            "statusMessage": "Checking command safety..."
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


The handler's 

type

 selects the mechanism. There are five:

command

 — run a shell command or executable. The default and most common. With 

command

 alone you get full shell processing (pipes, 

&&

 , redirects); with 

command

 + an 

args

 array you get exec form (no shell, each argument literal) — use exec form when paths or inputs may contain spaces or shell metacharacters.

http

 — POST the hook input JSON to a URL and read the JSON output from the response. Headers may reference environment variables, but only those you allow-list with 

allowedEnvVars

 .

mcp_tool

 — call a tool on a configured MCP server, with 

${path}

 substitution from the input fields.

prompt

 — ask a Claude model a yes/no question and use its answer as the decision.

agent

 — spawn a subagent to verify something (experimental).

Common fields apply across handler types: 

timeout

 (seconds; defaults are 600 for 

command

 / 

http

 / 

mcp_tool

 , 30 for 

prompt

 , 60 for 

agent

 , and 

UserPromptSubmit

 lowers the command/http/mcp_tool default to 30), 

statusMessage

 (custom spinner text), 

if

 (a permission-rule expression like 

Bash(git *)

 that further filters when the hook runs), and 

async

 / 

asyncRewake

 for background execution. 

disableAllHooks: true

 turns everything off, respecting the hierarchy.

The hook receives its input as JSON on stdin. The minimal pattern in any language is: read stdin, parse the JSON, branch on the fields, and either exit with a code or print a JSON decision. Path placeholders — 

${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}

 , 

${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}

 , 

${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}

 — are expanded in 

command

 , 

args

 , and HTTP header values, and are also exported as environment variables to the spawned process. Always reference your hook scripts through 

${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}

 rather than a relative path, because a hook may run with a working directory you do not control.

You can inspect everything that is wired up with the 

/hooks

 command inside Claude Code — it lists every configured hook, its type, and its source layer (User / Project / Local / Plugin / Session / Built-in), read-only.

6.2 Handler Types Beyond command

Most hooks are 

command

 hooks, but the other four types each fit a specific need. The 

http

 type is for centralized policy: instead of shipping a script to every developer, point the hook at an internal endpoint that returns the same JSON decision shape. Allow-list exactly which environment variables may appear in headers with 

allowedEnvVars

 , and only target endpoints you control (Section 9).

{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "http",
            "url": "https://hooks.internal.example.com/claude/post-edit",
            "headers": { "Authorization": "Bearer $POLICY_TOKEN" },
            "allowedEnvVars": ["POLICY_TOKEN"],
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


The 

prompt

 type asks a Claude model to make the call — useful when the decision is too fuzzy for a regex but cheap enough to delegate to a fast model. The handler turns the model's judgment into a permission decision.

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "prompt",
            "prompt": "Does this command delete data, force-push, or exfiltrate files? Decide whether to allow or ask. Command: $ARGUMENTS",
            "model": "claude-haiku-4-5",
            "timeout": 30
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


The 

mcp_tool

 type routes the decision to a tool on a configured MCP server (with 

${path}

 substitution from the input), and the experimental 

agent

 type spawns a subagent to verify something more involved. Both trade latency for capability; reserve them for checks that genuinely need an external service or multi-step reasoning, and keep the per-call cost in mind on hot tool-loop events.

6.3 Testing and Debugging Hooks

A hook is code, so test it like code before you trust it with a block decision. The fastest loop is to feed the hook a realistic event on stdin and inspect what it prints:

# Feed a hook a realistic event on stdin and inspect what it returns.
echo '{
  "hook_event_name": "PreToolUse",
  "tool_name": "Bash",
  "tool_input": { "command": "rm -rf /" }
}' | .claude/hooks/guard.py

# Expected: a deny decision on stdout, exit code 0.
# {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny", ...}}


Three more habits pay off. Run 

/hooks

 inside Claude Code to see exactly which hooks are registered and from which settings layer — this catches the common case where a hook lives in the wrong file or a matcher never matches. Start Claude Code with 

claude --debug

 to watch hook execution, stdout, stderr, and exit codes in real time. And remember the two silent-failure modes from Section 10: a malformed JSON object on stdout (often a stray 

echo

 that should have gone to 

stderr

 ) is ignored, and a non-blocking exit code (anything other than 

2

 for a gate) lets the action through. When a hook "does nothing," it is almost always one of these.

6.4 Hooks in Skills and Agents

Hooks are not confined to 

settings.json

 . A skill or a subagent can carry its own hooks in its YAML frontmatter, scoped to the lifetime of that component — the hooks are active only while the skill or agent is loaded, and they go away when it unloads. This is the right home for a hook that only makes sense inside a specific workflow: a release skill that confines edits to a release directory, say, or a review agent that logs every file it reads.

---
name: release-helper
description: Helps prepare and cut a release; keeps edits inside the release directory.
hooks:
  PreToolUse:
    - matcher: Write|Edit
      hooks:
        - type: command
          command: ${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/release-scope.sh
---

# Release Helper

While this skill is active, only edit files under release/ ...


The frontmatter form supports every hook event and the same handler types as 

settings.json

 . One extra field is available here: 

once: true

 runs the hook a single time per session and then removes it, which is handy for one-shot setup. And the subagent rule from Section 3 applies — a 

Stop

 hook declared in an agent's frontmatter is automatically treated as 

SubagentStop

 when that agent runs as a subagent. Because these hooks travel with the component, they are also a clean way to ship a guardrail as part of a reusable skill rather than asking every consumer to edit their settings.

7. Worked Examples

The examples below are complete and adaptable. Each pairs a 

settings.json

 fragment with the script it calls. They use 

jq

 to parse the stdin JSON in shell and the standard library in Python; both are dependency-light on purpose.

7.1 Auto-Format on Write (PostToolUse)

The most-requested hook: run a formatter every time the agent writes or edits a file, so the model never has to remember to. This reacts after the write, scoped to 

Write|Edit

 .

{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Write|Edit",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/format-file.sh",
            "timeout": 60
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/format-file.sh - format the file Claude just wrote.
set -euo pipefail

# The tool input arrives on stdin as JSON; pull the file path out of it.
file_path="$(jq -r '.tool_input.file_path // empty')"
[ -z "$file_path" ] && exit 0
[ -f "$file_path" ] || exit 0

case "$file_path" in
  *.py)        ruff format "$file_path" >&2 ;;
  *.ts|*.tsx|*.js|*.jsx|*.json|*.css|*.md) npx --no-install prettier --write "$file_path" >&2 ;;
  *.go)        gofmt -w "$file_path" >&2 ;;
  *)           exit 0 ;;
esac

exit 0


Two details matter. The formatter's chatter is redirected to 

stderr

 so it does not get parsed as a JSON decision on stdout. And the script exits 

0

 even when it does nothing — a formatter is a convenience, not a gate, so it should never block the turn.

7.2 Block Secrets and Dangerous Commands (PreToolUse deny)

This is the gate. One hook protects sensitive files from edits and refuses obviously destructive shell commands. It is scoped broadly ( 

*

 ) because it inspects more than one tool.

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/guard.py",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env python3
# .claude/hooks/guard.py - deny edits to secrets and destructive bash.
import json
import re
import sys

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
tool = data.get("tool_name", "")
tool_input = data.get("tool_input", {})


def deny(reason: str) -> None:
    # PreToolUse uses hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision, not a top-level decision.
    print(json.dumps({
        "hookSpecificOutput": {
            "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
            "permissionDecision": "deny",
            "permissionDecisionReason": reason,
        }
    }))
    sys.exit(0)


# 1. Protect sensitive files from any file-writing tool.
if tool in ("Write", "Edit", "MultiEdit"):
    path = tool_input.get("file_path", "")
    if re.search(r"(^|/)\.env($|\.)|/secrets?/|\.pem$|/\.aws/credentials$", path):
        deny(f"Refusing to modify sensitive file: {path}")

# 2. Refuse clearly destructive shell commands.
if tool == "Bash":
    command = tool_input.get("command", "")
    dangerous = [
        r"\brm\s+-rf\s+/(?!\w)",   # rm -rf / (not /tmp/foo)
        r"\bgit\s+push\s+.*--force\b",
        r"\bmkfs\b", r"\bdd\s+if=.*of=/dev/",
    ]
    for pattern in dangerous:
        if re.search(pattern, command):
            deny(f"Blocked a potentially destructive command (matched /{pattern}/).")

# Nothing matched - defer to the normal permission flow.
sys.exit(0)


Returning 

deny

 with a clear 

permissionDecisionReason

 is better than exiting 

2

 , because the reason is structured and reaches the model cleanly. Note that this is a guardrail, not a complete security boundary — a determined adversary can obfuscate a command past a regex. Treat it as defense in depth alongside the permission system and a properly sandboxed environment, not as a substitute for them.

7.3 Audit Logging (PostToolUse)

Append a structured record of every tool call to a JSONL file. This is invaluable for reviewing what an autonomous run actually did.

{
  "hooks": {
    "PostToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "*",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/audit.sh",
            "timeout": 10,
            "async": true
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/audit.sh - append a one-line audit record per tool call.
set -euo pipefail

log_dir="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/audit"
mkdir -p "$log_dir"

# Re-emit the input with a timestamp; keep only the fields we care about.
jq -c '{
  ts: now | todateiso8601,
  session: .session_id,
  tool: .tool_name,
  input: .tool_input
}' >> "$log_dir/tool-calls.jsonl"

exit 0


Marking the handler 

async: true

 runs it in the background so logging never adds latency to the turn — appropriate because the audit record has no decision to make.

7.4 Guard the End of a Turn (Stop)

Refuse to let the turn end while there are uncommitted changes, nudging the model to finish the job. Because a 

Stop

 hook that always blocks would loop forever, this one only blocks once and uses a marker file to avoid re-triggering.

{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/stop-guard.sh",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/stop-guard.sh - warn once about uncommitted changes at end of turn.
set -euo pipefail
cd "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"

marker="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/.stop-guard-fired"

# Already nudged once this turn? Let the model stop.
if [ -f "$marker" ]; then
  rm -f "$marker"
  exit 0
fi

if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain 2>/dev/null)" ]; then
  touch "$marker"
  # decision:block on a Stop hook sends control back to the model with the reason.
  jq -n '{
    decision: "block",
    reason: "There are uncommitted changes. Review them and either commit or explain why they should be left, then finish."
  }'
  exit 0
fi

exit 0


The marker file is the anti-infinite-loop discipline: the hook blocks at most once per turn, then steps aside. Section 10 expands on why this matters.

7.5 Inject Context at Session Start (SessionStart)

Seed every new session with the repository's current state so the model starts oriented. 

SessionStart

 stdout is injected into context, so a plain 

echo

 is enough — no JSON required.

{
  "hooks": {
    "SessionStart": [
      {
        "matcher": "startup|resume",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/session-context.sh",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/session-context.sh - print repo state for context injection.
set -euo pipefail
cd "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}"

echo "## Repository context (injected at session start)"
echo
echo "Branch: $(git branch --show-current 2>/dev/null || echo 'n/a')"
echo
echo "Recent commits:"
git log --oneline -5 2>/dev/null || echo "  (no git history)"
echo
echo "Working tree status:"
git status --short 2>/dev/null || echo "  (clean)"

exit 0


For richer setups, the JSON form of 

SessionStart

 output can also set a 

sessionTitle

 , declare 

watchPaths

 for 

FileChanged

 , or supply an 

initialUserMessage

 . And if you need an environment variable to persist into every later 

Bash

 call, write 

export VAR=value

 to the file named by 

$CLAUDE_ENV_FILE

 from this same hook.

7.6 Checkpoint Before Compaction (PreCompact)

On a long autonomous run, Claude Code compacts the transcript as it approaches the context limit — summarizing earlier turns and discarding their detail. If the agent has been keeping working notes, a 

PreCompact

 hook can snapshot them to disk first, so nothing important is lost to the summary. Scoping the matcher to 

auto

 targets the automatic, context-pressure compactions rather than a manual 

/compact

 .

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreCompact": [
      {
        "matcher": "auto",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/checkpoint.sh",
            "timeout": 15
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env bash
# .claude/hooks/checkpoint.sh - snapshot scratch notes before auto-compaction.
set -euo pipefail

notes="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/scratch/NOTES.md"
dest_dir="${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/checkpoints"
mkdir -p "$dest_dir"

# The important state must survive the summary that is about to replace earlier
# turns, so copy the working notes alongside a timestamp marker.
ts="$(date -u +%Y%m%dT%H%M%SZ)"
[ -f "$notes" ] && cp "$notes" "$dest_dir/NOTES-$ts.md"

exit 0


This pairs well with a scratchpad convention in 

CLAUDE.md

 : the model writes durable notes to a known file, and the 

PreCompact

 hook guarantees a copy survives each compaction boundary.

7.7 Reject a Policy-Violating Prompt (UserPromptSubmit)

A 

UserPromptSubmit

 hook sees the prompt before the model does, and can both inject context and reject the turn outright. This example enforces a simple deployment-freeze policy: if a freeze marker is present, any prompt that asks to deploy is blocked before the model can act on it; otherwise the freeze status is injected as context so the model stays aware of it.

{
  "hooks": {
    "UserPromptSubmit": [
      {
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/freeze-gate.py",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env python3
# .claude/hooks/freeze-gate.py - block deploy prompts during a release freeze.
import json
import os
import sys

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
prompt = data.get("prompt", "").lower()
project = os.environ.get("CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR", ".")
frozen = os.path.exists(os.path.join(project, ".deploy-freeze"))

asks_to_deploy = any(k in prompt for k in ("deploy", "release to prod", "ship it"))

if frozen and asks_to_deploy:
    print(json.dumps({
        "decision": "block",
        "reason": "A deployment freeze is in effect (.deploy-freeze present). "
                  "Deployment prompts are blocked until the freeze is lifted.",
    }))
    sys.exit(0)

# Otherwise inject the freeze status as context (UserPromptSubmit stdout is read by the model).
print("Deployment freeze:", "ACTIVE" if frozen else "none")
sys.exit(0)


Because 

UserPromptSubmit

 stdout is injected as context, the non-blocking path simply prints the status and the model reads it on every turn. The blocking path returns 

decision: "block"

 with a reason, and the prompt never reaches the model — deterministic policy, not a request the model may decline to honor. The same shape generalizes to any prompt-level guardrail: redacting a pattern, requiring a ticket reference, or refusing work outside business hours.

7.8 Rewrite a Tool Call In Place (PreToolUse updatedInput)

A 

PreToolUse

 hook does not have to be a binary gate — it can also 

edit

 the call before it runs. Returning 

permissionDecision: "allow"

 together with an 

updatedInput

 object replaces the tool's arguments with your version. The most useful application is making a slightly dangerous command safe rather than rejecting it outright: here, rewriting a bare 

git push --force

 into the safer 

--force-with-lease

 so the agent keeps moving without clobbering a teammate's work.

{
  "hooks": {
    "PreToolUse": [
      {
        "matcher": "Bash",
        "hooks": [
          {
            "type": "command",
            "command": "${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}/.claude/hooks/safe-push.py",
            "timeout": 10
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}


#!/usr/bin/env python3
# .claude/hooks/safe-push.py - downgrade a force-push to force-with-lease in place.
import json
import re
import sys

data = json.load(sys.stdin)
tool_input = data.get("tool_input", {})
command = tool_input.get("command", "")

# Only rewrite a git push that forces but does not already lease.
if re.search(r"\bgit\s+push\b", command) and "--force" in command \
        and "--force-with-lease" not in command:
    rewritten = command.replace("--force", "--force-with-lease")
    print(json.dumps({
        "hookSpecificOutput": {
            "hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
            "permissionDecision": "allow",
            "updatedInput": {**tool_input, "command": rewritten},
            "additionalContext": "Rewrote --force to --force-with-lease.",
        }
    }))
    sys.exit(0)

# Nothing to rewrite - defer to the normal permission flow.
sys.exit(0)


Two rules keep this pattern safe. The rewrite and the decision travel together: 

updatedInput

 is honored only alongside a 

permissionDecision

 of 

allow

 or 

ask

 — never with 

deny

 , and never on its own. And because the tool now runs a command the model did not write, re-validate the rewritten arguments as carefully as you would the original; a careless transform is just a new place for a bug to hide. Reach for in-place rewriting sparingly — it is powerful, but a user who sees one command in the transcript and a different one in the result is right to be surprised, so keep the transformation small, total, and obvious.

8. Hooks vs Permissions vs CLAUDE.md

Claude Code gives you three ways to shape what the agent does, and they are not interchangeable. Choosing the wrong one is how teams end up with guardrails that quietly do not hold.

CLAUDE.md is guidance.

 It is text placed in the model's context. It shapes behavior through instruction, and the model follows it most of the time — but it is advisory by construction. Use it for conventions, preferences, and the "how we like to work here" that benefits from the model's judgment: coding style, which libraries to prefer, how to phrase commit messages. Never rely on it for anything that must not happen.

Permissions are the allow/deny rule layer.

 The permission system decides, rule by rule, whether a given tool call is allowed, denied, or needs to ask — 

Bash(npm run test:*)

 allowed, 

Read(./.env)

 denied, and so on. Permissions are deterministic and declarative, and they are the right tool for static, expressible policy: this set of commands is fine, that set is not. They are evaluated by the harness, not the model.

Hooks are programmable enforcement.

 Where a permission rule expresses 

what

 is allowed as a static pattern, a hook runs 

code

 at a lifecycle point and can make a decision no static rule can: inspect the actual contents of a file before allowing the edit, call out to a policy service, rewrite a command, or react to a result. A hook can do everything a permission rule can and more — at the cost of being code you have to write and trust.

The three layers on one requirement.

 Take a single concern — "the production credentials file must never be edited." In 

CLAUDE.md

 you might write 

"never modify config/prod.env "

; the model will comply most of the time, but a confused or adversarially-steered turn can still try, and nothing stops it. A permission rule makes the refusal deterministic for that exact path — deny the read, write, and edit of 

config/prod.env

 and the harness enforces it with no judgment involved. A 

PreToolUse

 hook reaches past what a static path can express: it can deny edits to 

any

 file whose contents look like a credential regardless of its name, escalate an unusual case to 

ask

 , and append an audit record of every attempt for later review. The same requirement is served loosely by the first layer, firmly by the second, and programmably by the third — and a hardened setup typically runs all three at once, each catching what the others let through.

The mental model: 

CLAUDE.md

 persuades, permissions filter, hooks enforce-and-react. They compose. A typical hardened setup uses 

CLAUDE.md

 for conventions, permission rules for the broad static allow/deny policy, and hooks for the dynamic checks and the post-action reactions (format, lint, audit) that rules cannot express. When a requirement is "this must be deterministically prevented or deterministically done," it belongs in permissions or hooks — not in 

CLAUDE.md

 . The 

Harness and Environment Engineering Guide

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_code_harness_and_environment_engineering_guide.html

 develops this layering across the whole control stack; the 

Features and Settings Reference

https://hidekazu-konishi.com/entry/claude_code_features_settings_reference_2026.html

 documents the permission rule syntax hooks sit alongside.

9. Security Considerations

The first thing to internalize about hooks is that 

a hook is arbitrary code execution that you have authorized to run automatically.

 A 

command

 hook runs with your full shell privileges — your 

$PATH

 , your environment variables, your credentials, your network access, your ability to modify or delete files. Claude Code executes it without asking, at the lifecycle point you configured, every time. This is the source of all of the hook security model, and it cuts in several directions.

A hook config is executable, so treat it like code.

 When you clone a repository and it ships a 

.claude/settings.json

 with hooks, those hooks will run on your machine the moment you trigger their events. Review hooks from untrusted repositories exactly as you would review a 

Makefile

 or a 

package.json

 

postinstall

 script — because they have the same power. Project hooks live in 

.claude/settings.json

 (committed, shared) and 

.claude/settings.local.json

 (git-ignored, personal); know which is which before you trust either.

Managed settings are how an organization makes a guardrail non-negotiable.

 Because the resolution order is Managed > Local > Project > Plugin > User, a hook defined in managed policy settings cannot be removed or overridden by a developer's personal config. The 

allowManagedHooksOnly: true

 flag goes further, blocking all user, project, and plugin hooks so that only organization-approved hooks run at all. This is the correct place for a security control that must hold across an entire fleet — a 

PreToolUse

 deny hook that protects production credentials, say — because no individual can turn it off.

A rewriting hook becomes a tool-call author.

 The moment a 

PreToolUse

 hook returns 

updatedInput

 (Section 7.8), it stops merely observing the model's command and starts producing one. That rewritten command runs with your full privileges and skips the interactive prompt, so a logic error in the rewrite is a silent grant of action. Treat rewrite hooks as the most safety-critical code in your hook set: keep the transformation small and total, re-validate the result, and prefer rejecting an input you do not fully understand over rewriting it into something you only believe is safe.

The HTTP handler sends data off the machine, so constrain it.

 An 

http

 hook POSTs the full hook input — which can include prompts, file paths, and command strings — to a URL. Only point it at endpoints you control, and use 

allowedEnvVars

 to allow-list exactly which environment variables may appear in headers, so a hook cannot smuggle an arbitrary secret into an outbound request.

Mind the trust boundary around hook input.

 The 

tool_input

 a hook inspects was produced by the model, which may be acting on untrusted content (a web page, an issue comment, a file). Write hooks defensively: validate and quote everything, never 

eval

 a field from the input, and prefer exec-form 

command

 + 

args

 over shell-form when a path or argument could contain metacharacters. A guard hook that itself mishandles a crafted command is worse than no hook at all.

Logs are a data-handling decision.

 Audit hooks (Section 7.3) write tool inputs to disk. Those inputs can contain secrets, tokens, or personal data. Decide deliberately where the logs live, who can read them, and how long they are retained — an audit trail that leaks is its own incident.

Finally, hooks run without a controlling terminal — there is no 

/dev/tty

 — so a hook cannot prompt interactively; use the JSON 

ask

 decision or a notification instead. And a hook that hangs holds up the agent, so always set a 

timeout

 appropriate to the work.

10. Anti-Patterns and Pitfalls

Hooks fail in a small number of recognizable ways. Knowing them up front saves an afternoon of confusion.

The slow hook tax.

 Synchronous hooks run on the critical path — Claude Code waits for them. A 

PreToolUse

 hook that takes two seconds adds two seconds to 

every

 matching tool call, and in an agentic run that is thousands of calls. Keep gate hooks fast (single-digit seconds), set a tight 

timeout

 , and push anything non-decisive — logging, notifications, formatting that need not block — to 

async: true

 so it runs in the background.

Confusing the two JSON shapes.

 This is the single most common bug. 

PreToolUse

 decisions live under 

hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision

 ( 

allow

 / 

deny

 / 

ask

 / 

defer

 ); almost everything else uses a top-level 

decision: "block"

 with 

reason

 . Returning a top-level 

decision

 from a 

PreToolUse

 hook, or a 

permissionDecision

 from a 

PostToolUse

 hook, silently does nothing. When a hook "isn't working," check the shape against the event first.

Exit code mix-ups.

 Exit 

2

 blocks; any other non-zero is a 

non-blocking

 error that is logged and ignored. A guard hook that means to block but exits 

1

 will let the action through while looking like it ran. And a stray 

print

 / 

echo

 to stdout in a hook that exits 

0

 becomes malformed JSON — redirect diagnostics to 

stderr

 .

Infinite loops at the turn boundary.

 A 

Stop

 hook that always blocks creates a loop: the model tries to stop, the hook says "keep going," the model works and tries to stop again, the hook blocks again. The same trap exists when a 

UserPromptSubmit

 hook spawns work that triggers more 

UserPromptSubmit

 events. Always give a blocking 

Stop

 (or 

SubagentStop

 ) hook a termination condition — the marker-file pattern in Section 7.4, a bounded retry count, or a check of the transcript — so it cannot block twice for the same reason.

Assuming subagent behavior matches the main agent.

 Hooks fire inside subagents too, and the semantics differ in ways that surprise people. A 

Stop

 hook registered for a subagent is automatically converted to 

SubagentStop

 . Subagents do not automatically inherit the main agent's permissions, so a 

PreToolUse

 hook may be the thing standing between a subagent and an unapproved tool. Use the 

agent_id

 and 

agent_type

 fields in the input to tell whose tool call you are inspecting, and test guardrails with subagents in the loop, not just the main agent.

OS and environment assumptions.

 Hooks run as real processes on the host. A hook that shells out to 

jq

 , 

prettier

 , or 

ruff

 assumes those binaries are on 

$PATH

 — which may differ from your interactive shell, and differs again on Windows ( 

shell: "powershell"

 ) versus macOS and Linux. Reference scripts through 

${CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR}

 rather than relative paths, do not assume a particular working directory, and keep portability in mind if the hooks are committed for a team on mixed platforms.

Mistaking allow for a way to loosen policy.

 A 

PreToolUse

 hook can tighten what the permission system allows, but it cannot loosen it. Returning 

permissionDecision: "allow"

 skips the interactive prompt — it does 

not

 override a matching 

deny

 or 

ask

 rule in settings, which are still evaluated. Wire an 

allow

 hook expecting it to unblock a command that a deny rule forbids and the call stays blocked while the hook looks broken. When you genuinely need to permit something, change the permission rule; reserve hook 

allow

 for auto-approving calls that were already going to be allowed.

Over-hooking.

 Not every preference needs a hook. If the cost of the model occasionally not doing something is low, 

CLAUDE.md

 guidance is lighter weight and easier to maintain. Reserve hooks for what must be deterministic — the things whose failure you cannot tolerate. A wall of hooks that each save a few keystrokes is harder to reason about than a couple that enforce what actually matters.

11. Frequently Asked Questions

What are Claude Code hooks?

Hooks are user-defined commands that Claude Code runs automatically at fixed points in the tool-and-conversation lifecycle — before and after tool calls, when a prompt is submitted, when a session starts, when the model tries to stop, and more. Unlike instructions in 

CLAUDE.md

 , which the model follows by choice, hooks are executed deterministically by the harness, so they can enforce policy that must hold regardless of what the model decides.

How do I block a tool call?

Register a 

PreToolUse

 hook, inspect the 

tool_name

 and 

tool_input

 from the JSON on stdin, and either exit with code 

2

 (printing the reason to stderr) or — better — exit 

0

 and print 

{"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse", "permissionDecision": "deny", "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}

 . The 

deny

 decision blocks the call and sends your reason to the model. See Section 7.2 for a complete example.

What is the difference between PreToolUse and PostToolUse?

 

PreToolUse

 fires 

before

 a tool runs and can block it — it is for prevention (deny a command, protect a file, require confirmation). 

PostToolUse

 fires 

after

 a tool succeeds and cannot undo it — it is for reaction (format the file that was just written, lint it, log it, feed context back to the model). If you need to stop something, use 

PreToolUse

 ; if you need to respond to something that already happened, use 

PostToolUse

 .

How do I auto-format on save?

Use a 

PostToolUse

 hook matched to 

Write|Edit

 . Read 

tool_input.file_path

 from the stdin JSON, run your formatter on that path (sending its output to stderr so it is not parsed as a decision), and exit 

0

 . Because the formatter is a convenience rather than a gate, it should never block — always exit 

0

 . Section 7.1 has the full script.

Do hooks run for subagents?

Yes. Hooks fire inside subagents, with a few differences: a 

Stop

 hook registered for a subagent is automatically treated as 

SubagentStop

 , the input carries 

agent_id

 and 

agent_type

 so you can identify the subagent, and subagents do not automatically inherit the main agent's permissions — so a 

PreToolUse

 hook may be the only thing gating a subagent's tool calls. Dedicated 

SubagentStart

 and 

SubagentStop

 events bracket each subagent's run.

12. Summary

Hooks are the layer where Claude Code stops asking and starts enforcing. The model proposes; the harness, through your hooks, disposes — deterministically, at well-defined points in the lifecycle. The working knowledge fits on a card: pick the event for the boundary you care about ( 

PreToolUse

 to prevent, 

PostToolUse

 to react, 

UserPromptSubmit

 and 

SessionStart

 to inject context, 

Stop

 to guard the turn, 

PreCompact

 to checkpoint); communicate back with an exit code for simple block/allow or a JSON object for real decisions, remembering that 

PreToolUse

 uses 

hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision

 while most other events use a top-level 

decision

 ; scope with matchers, watching the MCP regex trap; and place the definition in the settings layer whose authority matches the control — managed settings for guardrails no one may override. Above all, remember that a hook is arbitrary code running with your privileges: keep gate hooks fast, give blocking 

Stop

 hooks a termination condition, and review hooks from repositories you do not control.

Hooks are one layer of a larger control stack. For how they fit alongside the permission system, the environment, and the rest of the harness, see the
